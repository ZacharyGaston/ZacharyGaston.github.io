/**
 * 
 * LOOPS:
 * 
 * 0. In Javascript, there are three possible loops that are available to programmers. Anytime that
 * you want to perform any kind of iteration of information repeatedly, loops will be the ideal go to for
 * doing so. Loops contain the following within their syntax structure, a starting condition, a stopping 
 * condition, an incrementor or a decrementor, and a code block. They also have the ability to be nested inside
 * of each other or inside of functions.
